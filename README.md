# 2022FIFAWorldCupDataVisualization
As we all know, the 2022 Qatar World Cup came to an end on December 18, 2022. The World Cup, one of the largest events in the world of sports, has always been the stage that football players aspire to. Lionel Messi, one of the most famous football players, finally won the World Cup championship in his fifth World Cup appearance. Our project will start from the World Cup final and analyze the performance of both sides on the field, and the impact of these data on both teams. I hope this project can let everyone have a better understanding and appreciation of the World Cup, also be interested in football.
